# HTTP5122 â€” Front-End Development (JavaScript)

Welcome to my **HTTP5122 â€” Front-End Development** repository!  
This repo includes my weekly exercises, assignments, and mini-projects focused entirely on **JavaScript**.  
Here, I practice how to write clean code, build logic, and create interactive elements for web pages.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

- Variables, data types, and operators  
- Functions and conditionals  
- Loops and arrays  
- Objects and classes  
- DOM selection and manipulation  
- Events and interactivity  
- Fetch API and JSON basics

>  **Info:**  
> All examples in this repo were written using plain JavaScript â€” no external frameworks.  
> The goal is to master the **core language** before moving to libraries like React or Vue.

## Note

These exercises are part of a learning process.  
Some projects may include **simplified logic** or **basic styling** since the focus is strictly on functionality, not design.
